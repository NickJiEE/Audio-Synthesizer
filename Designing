Generating Waveforms
Define parameters: We specify the sampling frequency, duration of the waveform, and frequency of the sine wave.
Generate time vector: We create a time vector t using linspace() that spans the duration of the waveform.
Generate sine wave: Using the formula for a sine wave, we generate the waveform sine_wave.
Plot the waveform: Finally, we use plot() to visualize the generated sine wave.

Implementing a Linear Filter
Define filter parameters: Specify the sampling frequency, initial cutoff frequency, and filter type ('low' for a low-pass filter).
Design the filter: Use the designfilt() function from the Signal Processing Toolbox to design a low-pass FIR filter with the specified parameters.
Generate a noisy signal: Create an example signal with noise for demonstration purposes.
Apply the filter: Use the designed filter to filter the noisy signal.
Plot original and filtered signals: Visualize the original and filtered signals using plot().
